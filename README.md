# odin-recipes

So in this Odin project I will be creating a recipes website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a 4 recipes.

I will use HTML and the knowledge I have gained thus far to complete this task.

Once done, I will use the knowledge I have with using Git Version control, to upload and push my work onto Git Hub.
Some of the skills displayed will be: using the Html Boilerplate learned, setting up headers with unordered lists and ordered lists, using italicized and bold text to emphasize, using relative links, displaying images in each recipe.
